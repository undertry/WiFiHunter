# WiFiHunter  

**WiFiHunter** is a Python-based tool designed to automate vulnerability scans, device service checks, and WiFi network detection.  

These scripts were developed as part of a thesis project called **NVS** and are intended to be executed remotely through a web interface. Flask is used as the API server to enable seamless communication between the web interface and the scripts.  


## 🚀 Features  
- Automated vulnerability scanning.  
- Device service checks.  
- Detection of available WiFi networks.  
- Remote execution through a web interface.  


## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
- **Python**: Core programming language for scripts.  
- **Flask**: API server for communication between the web interface and backend scripts.  

## 🖥️ How to Run  
### Prerequisites  
1. Install Python 3.8 or later.  
2. Install Flask:
   
   `
   pip install flask
   `  

### Steps  
1. Clone the repository:
   
   `
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WiFiHunter.git
   cd WiFiHunter
   `  

3. Start the Flask API server:
     
   `
   python src/api/server.py
   ` 

5. Access the web interface (if implemented) via the specified address (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).
